# hexgrid
Hexagonal grid implementation in FreeBASIC based https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/

# To do
Demo:
- cirkel
- path finding
- Hexatris
- Flat / streched grid (size x/y)

To do (not yet implemented):
- Draw_hex_filled
- Movement Range -> return list of hex tiles?
- Obstacles / path-finding -> return list of hex tiles?
- 60Â° rotation around other hex 
- Ring / circle -> return list of hex tiles?
- Spiral ring -> return list of hex tiles?
- Field of view (if needed, complex)
- Name change: hex_axial --> hex, hex_cube --> cube
- Offset coordinates (Neighbors, Distance, Offset coordinates)
- Doubled coordinates (Neighbors, Distance, Hex_to_pixel)
